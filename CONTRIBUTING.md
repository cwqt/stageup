# Git Branching

When working on a feature, always create your branch off dev. 

* First switch to dev: `git checkout dev`
* Pull any new changes so you are up to date: `git pull`
* Create a new local branch and switch to it (use capitals for SU!): `git checkout -b SU-XXX`
* Push this local branch to GitHub: `git push --set-upstream origin SU-XXX`
* Commit as usual with: `git commit -m "Commit message"`
* Push changes to GitHub with: `git push`
