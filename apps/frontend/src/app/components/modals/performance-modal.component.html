            <p>I returned, however, with unabated vigor to my workâ€”a more arduous task than 
            anyone can imagine, who has not felt something like the misery of being charged 
            with the care and direction of a set of mischievous, turbulent rebels, whom
            his utmost exertions cannot bind to their duty, while, at the same time, 
            he is responsible for their conduct to a higher power, who exacts from him what 
            cannot be achieved without the aid of the superior's more potent authority, which,
            either from indolence, or the fear of becoming unpopular with the said rebellious 
            gang, the latter refuses to give. I can conceive few situations more harassing than 
            that wherein, however you may long for success, however you may labor to fulfill your
            duty, your efforts are baffled and set at naught by those beneath you, and unjustly 
            censured and misjudged by those above.</p>
